## Advanced probability

- `stochastic process`
- `information theory`

**tips: If you wanna some resources in the HUST like labs or projects, check `./HUST-xxx` for more details.**

This folder has contained some files about the topic `advanced probability` , which is a very important part in the EE and CS. It will provide you a better understanding of the whole world like communication networks, control systems or machine learning.

### Course Outline

1. Fundamentals of Probability / 4 weeks

   - Review of probability basics and common distributions
   - Transforms of random variables, concentration inequalities
   - Convergence, law of large numbers, central limit theorem
2. Information Theory and Random Processes / 5 weeks

    - Information theory
    - Discrete time Markov chains
    - Poisson processes
    - Continuous time Markov chains

3. Estimation and Hilbert Space of Random Variables / 4 weeks
  - Maximum likelihood estimate, maximum a posteriori estimate, hypothesis testing
  - Hilbert space of random variables
  - LLSE estimate, MMSE estimate
  - Jointly Gaussian random variables and Kalman filter
  - Hidden Markov models

Although, it may not as clear as the courses in the HUST, but the labs maybe very interesting. While another interesting point is in the folder `./Other labs`, you can get a detailed explaination in its `README` file.
