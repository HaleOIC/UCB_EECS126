## README

This folder has contained a lab which comes from the `ECE537`, acutally I do not know his school and course resources, but his `Pluto` elegent UI attracts me a lot, and its labs' handout is very skillful. Due to the poor inner-class resources, so I wanna do it for better undestanding.

It has contained five labs`1-5`, while `Julia` is a new language for me, so I add a `Lab0` into the folder which contains some basic programmas in `Julia`.

The framework of the labs are:

- `lab0`: basic introduction to `Julia` and `Pluto`
- `lab1`: `CDF` and `PMF` example

when using the `Pluto` as notebook, I find it is really interestring and interactive, you can learn a lot when you install `Pluto` and check the `Getting started`.
